The Akamai for WordPress plugin integrates automatically with Akamai to purge the cache when you create or update a post/page.

== Description ==

The Akamai for WordPress plugin will automatically purge the cache using the new Fast Purge feature whenever you create or update a post.

With the Fast Purge API, you can automate your publishing flow to maximize performance and offload without compromising on freshness. Switching to a Hold â€˜Til Told methodology, you can cache semi-dynamic content with long TTLs, and then refresh it in approximately 5 seconds with Fast Purge.

= Development & Support =

This plugin is developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/akamai/wp-akamai). Issues should be filed [here](https://github.com/akamai/wp-akamai/issues).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Edit the Settings to add credentials

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How long does purging take? =

The purge request is almost instantaneous, and the purge itself is completed within 5 seconds.

= What is purged? =

By default, the front page, and the individual post page are purged. You can additionally enable purging of tag, category, and monthly archives.

= What are the limitations? =

This API supports the following rate limits per customer:
